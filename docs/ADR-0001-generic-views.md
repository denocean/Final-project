# ADR-0001: Use Django Generic Views for Blog

**Context:**
We need to display blog posts and handle CRUD operations efficiently.

**Decision:**
Use Django’s generic class-based views (ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView).

**Consequences:**
- Faster implementation, less boilerplate.
- Easier to maintain and extend.
- Aligns with Django best practices.
